        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- UPDATED ABOUT ME TEXT -->
        <p>While my primary professional focus lies elsewhere, game development is my true creative passion. It's a journey I've been exploring for years, starting as a hobbyist and gradually evolving into a semi-professional endeavor on a small scale. I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and I constantly seek opportunities to dive deeper into this exciting field.</p>
        <p>My projects showcase a wide array of skills across the game development pipeline: from intricate shader programming and physics simulations to crafting engaging gameplay mechanics, building robust systems, and collaborating effectively in diverse, international teams. Most of these projects originated from university courses, game jams, or personal explorations. Despite their hobbyist beginnings, they were developed with a strong emphasis on production-quality standards, reflecting a professional approach even in unpaid, indie settings.</p>
        <p>Beyond building games, I'm also deeply committed to fostering learning and knowledge sharing within the game development community. You can see an example of this in my past work with Marahil.org.</p>
        <p>Explore my projects below to see what I've been working on and the skills I bring to the table!</p>
