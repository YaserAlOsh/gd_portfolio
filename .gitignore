# Hugo ignores
# ========================

# Hugo's generated public directory
# (This is where your final static site files go, don't commit it)
/public/

# Hugo's cache directory
# (Temporary files used by Hugo for faster builds)
.hugo_build.lock
.hugo_build.lock.json
/resources/_gen/
/public/


# Build directory if you use a custom one (like 'docs' for GitHub Pages)
# If your publishDir is 'docs', then you *DO NOT* want to ignore 'docs'
# If you are publishing to 'docs' and you DO want to ignore the 'public' folder
# (which Hugo usually generates as a staging area before moving to docs)
# then ensure /public/ is listed above.
# If you use 'docs' as your publishDir, you would *not* ignore 'docs'.

# --- For GitHub Pages specific setup ---
# If your publishDir is 'docs', you want to *keep* the 'docs' folder in Git.
# If you are building locally and pushing 'docs', uncommenting /public/ is usually correct.
# If you are using GitHub Actions to build and deploy, then you just ignore 'public/'.
# In your current setup: publishDir = "docs", so you want 'docs' to be committed.
# Therefore, make sure /docs/ is NOT in this file.
